# Some-Kind-Of-Game
### Goals

-   Creating a basic game starting with no knowledge of programming

### Boundaries / Scope

-   download a program that will allow me to create the game
-   

### Success criteria

-  the main controls work correctly
-  games properties function as they should

### Constraints

-   My lack of knowledge and lack of game creating program to start with

### Assumptions

-   the game will be represnted easily after its programmed
-   there will be guides on how to preogram and create this game
-   I can find created assets to use for my game

### Stakeholders

-   Professor - for grade
-   Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud
-   Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job

### Timeline

Week:

-   1.find and download a game making program. (I am going to use unity) 3 hours deciding and downloading 2D Unity from the list of           options provided on the course website.
-   2.toy around and figure out the programming (I'm looking at the example game and its files for a bit of a understanding) I practiced      with the sample 2D game for about 4 hours looking at the files, sprites, and tutorial videos.
-   3.figure out the modeling or assets (I was able to download some free assets from the asset store) I spent about 2 hours looking for      the assets store and finding the assets I wanted to use. I also looked up videos of people using the same assets to see how the          character moves.
-   4.Start using some of the assets for characters and backgrounds (I was able to create the background and a platform with proper          layering.) I spent about 2 hours total looking for a tutorial videos on how to impliment tiles as the floor and placing a                background in the farthest back layering at -10 to not over layer the tile or potential sprites.
-   5.figure out a common sprite animation for collactables (I created a coin using the animation tools and the images provided) It took      about 2 hours total to find and implement a tutorial about giving the coin proper animations, collision, and gravity to fall on the      floor. I also gave the tile collision in a way that it looks like the objects are in the middle of the grass.
-   6.figure out how to use the character sprites and animations (I tried to use the images of the character as if it was a sprite like      the coin but it just shifted images instead of coming together.) I tried to find videos and tutorials about properly implementing        the PNGs given to me but I cound't find any easily and I accidently created a pulsateing peice of meat that was only shifting            though the images when i used the same method as the coin i created.
-   7.Put that character together (I finally found a tutorial talking about using each image seperatly and placing the character              together, I created the hero named "Meat", I even gave him a original idle animation using the animation tools. I attached a            picture of my Unity tool and the little area I made. I also uploaded a screen recording of the animations in action. I feel very        satisfied seeing the little hero animated and the coin colliding with the floor.) It took about 4 hours total to find a video, (it      took a while), about createing my hero with the seperate PNGs and creating the custom animations by using the Animation timeline        window and draging the body parts to create the aniamtions.
