# Some-Kind-Of-Game
### Goals

-   Creating a basic game starting with no knowledge of programming

### Boundaries / Scope

-   download a program that will allow me to create the game
-   

### Success criteria

-  the main controls work correctly
-  games properties function as they should

### Constraints

-   My lack of knowledge and lack of game creating program to start with

### Assumptions

-   the game will be represnted easily after its programmed
-   there will be guides on how to preogram and create this game
-   I can find created assets to use for my game

### Stakeholders

-   Professor - for grade
-   Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud
-   Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job

### Timeline

Week:

-   1.Find and download a game making program. (I am going to use unity) 3 hours deciding and downloading 2D Unity from the list of         options provided on the course website.
-   2.Toy around and figure out the programming (I'm looking at the example game and its files for a bit of a understanding) I               practiced with the sample 2D game for about 4 hours looking at the files, sprites, and tutorial videos.
-   3.Figure out the modeling or assets (I was able to download some free assets from the asset store) I spent about 2 hours looking         for the assets store and finding the assets I wanted to use. I also looked up videos of people using the same assets to see how         the character moves.
-   4.Start using some of the assets for characters and backgrounds (I was able to create the background and a platform with proper         layering.) I spent about 2 hours total looking for a tutorial videos on how to impliment tiles as the floor and placing a               background in the farthest back layering at -10 to not over layer the tile or potential sprites.
-   5.Figure out a common sprite animation for collactables (I created a coin using the animation tools and the images provided) It         took about 2 hours total to find and implement a tutorial about giving the coin proper animations, collision, and gravity to fall       on the floor. I also gave the tile collision in a way that it looks like the objects are in the middle of the grass.
-   6.Figure out how to use the character sprites and animations (I tried to use the images of the character as if it was a sprite           like the coin but it just shifted images instead of coming together.) I tried to find videos and tutorials about properly               implementing the PNGs given to me but I cound't find any easily and I accidently created a pulsateing peice of meat that was             only shifting though the images when i used the same method as the coin i created.
-   7.Put that character together (I finally found a tutorial talking about using each image seperatly and placing the character             together, I created the hero named "Meat", I even gave him a original idle animation using the animation tools. I attached a             picture of my Unity tool and the little area I made. I also uploaded a screen recording of the animations in action. I feel very         satisfied seeing the little hero animated and the coin colliding with the floor.) It took about 4 hours total to find a video, (it       took a while), about createing my hero with the seperate PNGs and creating the custom animations by using the Animation timeline         window and draging the body parts to create the aniamtions.
 -  8.I am looking around for various tutorials about giving my character movment but it turns out my little character is horrible and       does not function correctly at all. I decided to use a single picture for now to keep it simple until I understand how to create a       sprite sheet of my own and implement it properly. As I was searching I found a tutorial teaching a way to create a tile sheet, I         used this method instead of the long piece I had created because it looks nicer and I can create platforms that look nice with it. I     then created a small area to test potential collision, gravity, and movment. I found some tutorials on youtube and tried following       along but I got compiler errors after about a hour of following along and I couldn'd find what was wrong. These programs had me         using C# on Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and I am trying my best to give the gravity and physics to a small chest as a test subject.
 -  9.I am still using various tutorials in hopes to properly code my sprite but they are complicated and using foreign programs for me.     While I was on campus attending classes I found on google a tutorial from Unity themselves from their live sessions. When I got home     I followed along with the Recorded Video Session of 2D Platformer Character Controller. This tutorial looks good and the guide does     eveything step by step and explains what each piece does. I followed along and when I got to step 2 where we use code to script         gravity I followed along and when I tested it the chest.png I am using fell just like the example. Step 3 and 4 is where the             complications started to occur, both steps need to be done before you can test the games characters and models but when i finished       step 4 I was getting the compiler errors again. I wasn't sure what was wrong so I went back in the video and checked every piece of     code to make sure I typed averything correctly and capatalized everything properly. After I checked the video for quite some time I     tried again and the same error showed up, I then decided to look at the plain code they provide under the video and check my code       their. I had a few peices different from what was shown and I corrected my code but I still got the error, I got angry and saved my     original code in a different file and just copied and pasted the code from the example to the script. Of course this didn't work         either and now I am stuck with a large piece of code with a small error thats preventing me from continuing. (I am providing this       code in Github so I don't loose it aswell)
